# Information Visualization team 14 project

This project shows vizualization about disneyland reviews.

## How to run project?
If you only unzip folder and run it on the browser, you can't see vizualization in proper way, because some elements are loaded dynamically and because of interaction.
Below we describe how you can run it in the fastest way.

1) Install **Visual Studio Code** - you can download it from this site: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
2) Clone this [repository](https://github.com/karolinakowalczyk/InfoVisD3)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/karolinakowalczyk/InfoVisD3.git
```
3) Install **Live Server** extention for Visual Studio code and run project by using it (you should be in the folder with .html file) - [instruction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wue59ldqMg&ab_channel=TechStacker) how to do it
